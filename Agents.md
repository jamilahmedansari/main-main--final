## Quick Context

**App**: AI-powered legal letter SaaS with mandatory attorney review.  
**Stack**: Next.js 16 (App Router) | Supabase (Postgres + RLS) | OpenAI | Stripe | pnpm

```
User → Letter Form → AI Draft (GPT-4 Turbo) → Admin Review → PDF Download
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Role Verification

### Three Roles (Verify RLS Enforces These)

| Role         | Can Access                             | CANNOT Access                   |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `subscriber` | Own letters, subscription, profile     | Other users' data, admin portal |
| `employee`   | Own coupons, commissions               | **ANY letter content**          |
| `admin`      | Everything via `/secure-admin-gateway` | N/A                             |

### Single Admin Model (Critical)

There is **exactly ONE admin account** in the system - this admin IS the licensed attorney.

This **single admin (licensed attorney)** is responsible for:

- Reviewing every submitted letter in the **Review Center**
- **Editing/improving** letter content (including via AI assist)
- **Approving or rejecting** letters
- Monitoring **dashboard analytics**, including:
  - Letters generated / submitted / approved / rejected
  - Employee coupon code usage and discount impact
  - Employee commission totals and related metrics

> ⚠️ `is_super_user` = unlimited letters (subscriber business feature), **NOT** admin privilege.
>
> ⚠️ Employees are **salespeople**, NOT lawyers. They sell the service but never access letter content.

**Admin portal access rules**

- Admin access is **only** via `/secure-admin-gateway/*` using **email/password + portal key** (env-based).
- There is **no public admin signup** and no multi-admin model.

## Verification Checklist

### 1. Authentication Flows

- [ ] **Subscriber**: Sign up → redirects to `/dashboard`
- [ ] **Employee**: Has access to `/dashboard/coupons`, `/dashboard/commissions`
- [ ] **Admin**: Only accessible via `/secure-admin-gateway/login` (no public signup)
- [ ] **Cross-role**: Subscribers cannot access admin routes, employees cannot see letters

### 2. Letter Lifecycle

```
draft → generating → pending_review → under_review → approved/rejected → completed
```

- [ ] Letter form submission creates record with `draft` status
- [ ] AI generation updates to `generating` then `pending_review`
- [ ] Single admin starts review → updates to `under_review`
- [ ] Approval/rejection logged via `log_letter_audit()`
- [ ] Subscriber sees content ONLY after approval

### 3. Subscription & Credits

| Plan       | Price   | Credits          |
| ---------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| Free Trial | $0      | 1 (first letter) |
| Single     | $299    | 1                |
| Monthly    | $299/mo | 4                |
| Yearly     | $599/yr | 8                |

- [ ] Free trial: `count === 0` check works
- [ ] Credits deducted via `deduct_letter_allowance(u_id)`
- [ ] Subscriber with `is_super_user=true` bypasses credit check (unlimited)

### 4. Employee System

- [ ] Coupon auto-generated on employee role assignment (format: `EMP-XXXXXX`)
- [ ] Coupon applies 20% discount
- [ ] Commission: 5% of subscription amount
- [ ] Employee dashboard shows usage stats
- [ ] Verify employees cannot view letters or letter content (RLS + UI + API)

### 5. Admin Portal (Single Admin)

- [ ] Access: `/secure-admin-gateway/login`
- [ ] Auth: Email + Password + Portal Key (env-based)
- [ ] Session: 30-minute timeout
- [ ] Dashboard includes:
  - [ ] **Review Center** / queue for `pending_review` letters
  - [ ] Letter review actions: edit/improve, approve, reject
  - [ ] **Analytics** for letters and employee systems (coupons + commissions)

## Build Verification

```bash
pnpm install    # No dependency errors
pnpm build      # Must pass (no TypeScript/Next.js errors)
pnpm dev        # Runs at localhost:3000
pnpm lint       # ESLint passes
```

---

## End-to-End Test Flow

### Test 1: Subscriber Journey

1. Sign up as subscriber
2. Create letter (first is free)
3. Verify AI draft generated
4. Verify letter shows "Under Review" (content hidden)
5. As the single admin: review/edit as needed, then approve letter
6. Verify subscriber can now see content and download PDF

### Test 2: Employee Commission

1. Create employee user
2. Verify coupon auto-generated
3. Subscriber uses coupon at checkout
4. Verify 20% discount applied
5. Verify employee gets 1 point + 5% commission

### Test 3: Role Isolation

1. As employee: attempt to access `/api/letters` → should fail
2. As subscriber: attempt to access `/secure-admin-gateway` → should fail
3. Verify RLS prevents cross-user data access

## Safe Auto-Fixes (Agents May Perform)

✅ Install missing dependencies  
✅ Fix obvious import errors  
✅ Add missing TypeScript types  
✅ Update deprecated API calls (if migration is documented)

---

## Do NOT Auto-Fix

❌ Change role semantics  
❌ Bypass RLS policies  
❌ Modify database schema without migration script  
❌ Create new routes or flows not in codebase  
❌ Expose or log secrets
